#
# Given the head of a linked list, remove the n^th node from the end of the
# list and return its head.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
# Output: [1,2,3,5]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1], n = 1
# Output: []
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
# Output: [1]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the list is sz.
# 1 <= sz <= 30
# 0 <= Node.val <= 100
# 1 <= n <= sz
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?
