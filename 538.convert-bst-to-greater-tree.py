#
# Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree
# such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus
# the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.
# 
# As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these
# constraints:
# 
# 
# The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's
# key.
# The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the
# node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
# Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [0,null,1]
# Output: [1,null,1]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
# -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
# All the values in the tree are unique.
# root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
#
